# Project2
 
# Motivation for this project:
# During the past 3 years, I lived in Dubai and traveled to Africa several times. I also traveled to Germany, Turkey, Qatar, Oman, and Iceland for business reasons and vacations.
# Every time I traveled to a new country or new city, I did some surveys and observations for property prices.

# I still remember when I checked the property price in UAE, the price was really attractive and the property type and outlooking were beautiful.
# However, when I returned to Taiwan and saw the small and old houses in Taiwan with incredible prices, I thought "What is going on with Taiwanese' property"
# The price is much higher compared to other countries and the property we bought is really old and small.
# Therefore, I would like to use this chance to understand the trend of Taoyuan property prices.
# Taipei city and New Taipei city analysis I have already done in Tableau, if you are interested in my analysis, please check the below link:
